# TIL GIT August 1, 2019 

## Summary of Git 
Today I learned how to use Git Bash. Git makes a local repository on your computer. It takes snapshots of your files. 
You decide when to make a snapshot when making a **commit.** You can visit any snapshot at any time. You can stage files before committing. 
You usually want to make one repo for one project. 

## Summary of Github
Git hub is a remote repository. It is a version control system. It also offers source code management. It is a great way for developers to work together, keep things organized and share their projects. 

## Checking to see if Git is Installed 
```bash 
git --version

```
## GIT Basic Commands 
```bash 
git init #initialize a local git repository. When we run git init, it makes a directory .git (usually hidden). It is going to track all of our changes. 
git add <file> #add File(s) to index
git add  #will add all of the files 
git commit #commit changes in index. Making a checkpoint in time. 
git commit -m "leave your comment here, your comments need to be in present tense" 
```
#### Just by initializing  a repository in a folder, it doesn't necessarily track every file or change that you make. If you want git to know about a select amount of files in your folder. you have to git add.

```bash
git status #check status of working tree. 
git push #push to remote repository 
git pull #pull latest framework to reomte Repository 
git clone # clone a repository in a new directory

touch <fileName> #bash command

cd #change directory, go into the directory 
cd... To move into subfolders 
cd ~/projects/ #This sign stands for your user account's home folder. 
mkdir #make directory 

#the ls command 
ls #Lists the file contents of a directory. 
ls -la # -l Formats the output #-a lists hidden files 
la #This


pwd #print working directory  It will return the path to a local folder on your computer's disk.

#deleting
rm -rf #removing a directory 
rm path/tofile.ext #removng a field 
rm -r path/to/folder #-r stands for recursive, Deleting a folder 

#moving/renaming
mv path/to/file.ext different/pathf/file.ext #moving a file 
mv old-filename.ext new-filename.ext #The "mv" command can also be used to rename a file

cp #copy file 
```
# git checkout 
git log = wil give us a history of all of the gits in our repo 
git checkout, used to change branches and heckout "
git checkout = use a unique indentifier from the log version, make sure you commit everything before you go to a different version 

git checkout-b

git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jkapurchicago/bart-website.git
git push -u origin master
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/jkapurchicago/bart-website.git
git push -u origin master
